        <p>
          As a group of computer science students at Brown University, we wanted
          to iteratively design for a startup that is could be more practical in
          our daily life. We decided to design for a startup called Taro.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
          <img
            src="./images/taro-mission.png"
            class="d-block w-50 align-items-center"
            alt="taro's mission statement"

      <div class="row" id="sketching">
        <h2 class="text-center">Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
        <p>
          To summarize above, Taro is a website designed to be a premium
          subscription/membership based platform for software engineers who want
          to further their career. The idea is that with a payment, Taro will
          give exclusive access to information about jobs and how to get a job
          ranging from Q&As with leads from top tech companies and creating
          optimized performance reviews. The idea is to focus on the networking
          and non-technical side of the job.
          <br /><br />
          After looking at the concept of the startup, we assumed that our users
          consist of (1) software engineers currently employed, (2)
          undergraduate students looking for internship or post-grad
          opportunities, (3) recruiters at different companies. Software
          engineers who are currently employed would be impacted by this website
          because then they are able to learn tips and tricks about how to do
          their job better. Additionally, if they want to pivot companies, this
          website would provide valuable information for that. Undergraduate
          students would benefit from this because they are jumping into a field
          without much prior experience and would benefit from learning how to
          work as a software engineer and more specifically, how to work as a
          software engineer for a top tech company. Lastly, recruiters would
          benefit from the website because they are able to find software
          engineers who are ambitious and very much either currently on the job
          hunt or looking to further their career by switching companies. Our
          users who would interact with their desktop.

          Scenario Summary: You are Jeff Huang, a college computer science
          professor, who is thinking of going back into the software engineering
          industry. You bought a subscription to Taro, an exclusive software
          engineering career resource and networking platform. Your task is to
          find the Expert Advice article on an Amazon Recruiter's take on the
          recession and job market. (Note: This is a prototype and not an actual
          website so interactions may feel quite different). <br /><br />
          We analyzed their performance and commentary for each subtask.
          <br /><br />
          Go to sign in and login (Assume that the username and password are
          prefilled):
          <ul>
            <li>
              All users were able to complete the task and all noted that it was
              an easy process
            </li>
            <li>
              A few users noted how intuitive the location of the sign in button
              was and that the change to the home page with a profile picture
              where the sign in button was confirmed that they have successfully
              signed in
            </li>
            <li>
              This was in line with our expectations as we modeled our sign in
              process and layout similar to other platforms
            </li>
          </ul>
          Navigate to the Expert Advice page:
          <ul>
            <li>
              2 out of 3 users were able to navigate to the Expert Advice page
              by clicking on the Expert Advice button on the navigation bar
            </li>
            <li>
              One user directly went to the article from the home screen and was
              confused by the next subtask. He concluded that the login screen
              took him to the Expert Advice page as the back button was labeled
              so
            </li>
            <li>
              Though we expected for some users to directly go to the article,
              we did not expect his conclusion to be that the home screen to the
              Expert Advice page due to the back button in the article labeling
              back to Expert Advice
            </li>
          </ul>
          Go to the article titled "How to handle the recession from an Amazon
          recruiter's perspective”:
          <ul>
            <li>
              All users were able to go to the article and said that completing
              the task was very easy
            </li>
            <li>
              This was in line with our expectations as we explicitly stated the
              article title to look for
            </li>
          </ul>
          Sign out of your account:
          <ul>
            <li>
              2 out of 3 users successfully were able to complete the task and
              mentioned that the location of the sign out button (in a drop down
              after clicking profile picture) was very intuitive and followed
              the structure that all web pages follow
            </li>
            <li>
              One user clicked too far in the subtask step and the figma screen
              ended, but verbally told us his plan which was correct
            </li>
            <li>
              One user mentioned that a confirmation page that the signout was
              successful would have been nice
            </li>
            <li>
              This was in line with our expectations as followed the traditional
              logout location that most web pages follow
            </li>
          </ul>
          Based on the users' feedback, having the back button label be
          different for the article based on whether they navigated to the
          article from the Home page or Expert Advice page would help their
          understanding on what page they previously were in. Additionally,
          adding a successful sign out page after signing out would help the
          users confirm that they indeed did sign out. We feel confident in
          keeping all other aspects the same and the testing results were
          successful overall.

        <p>Finally, we shared our final prototype to the startup! We currently are waiting
          for their reply and will update this page if there are any updates!

        <p> We learned a lot about the iterative process of making an interaction prototype. 
          For complete transparency, the user test results were from a second set of tests since 
          our first one ended up quite badly due to misassumptions about the testing process and
          how intuitive the question flow and tasks would be for the users. Thus, we edited the tasks 
          to be much more explicit and learned how much the testing format and wording affect the user's 
          interaction.
