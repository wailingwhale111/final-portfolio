        This project was intended to teach the interactibility of React, where build an interface using components and internal data state using list-based interface. 
        I have decided to work with the kpop group called NCT; NCT is one of the unique groups 
        because they have this theme of "infinity." Currently, there are total of 23 members, 
        and more get added every year. Additionally, in K-Pop fandom, we have this term called 
        "bias" which refers to "favorite member(s)." Through my interactive interface, I wanted 
        the users to interact with my interface to curate their bias list. 
      </p>

      </h2>
      <p>
        The user will be able sort by age and alphabetical order of the members; filter by 
        sub-groups and position; and curate a bias list where it aggregates the list by giving
        average of their age.

        Design Principles
      </h2>
      <p>
        I tried to focus on three design principles we learned from the course as I played around with the layout: 
        (1) Hierarchy, (2) Learnability, and (3) Reversibility. 
      </p>
      <h4>
        Hierarchy 
      </h4>
      <p>
        The visual hierarchy refers to the organization of the design elements on the page so that the 
        eye is guided to consume each design element in the order of intended importance. In most of the 
        online shopping website, most of the filter and sorting buttons are on the top or on the left side. 
        I wanted to resemble this common layout so that the users' eyes can naturally lead to the familiar 
        places. <br/>
        Additionally, I arranged the card text in this way so that the users can know that the bolded text 
        is the members' names, then I put the information on the buttons on the left corresponds to the order
        I put the information on the card. 
      </p>
      <h4> 
        Learnability
      </h4>
      <p>
        Learnability considers how easy it is for users to accomplish a task the first time they encounter the interface and how
        many repetitions it takes for them to become efficient at that task. When you first load the page, 
        I wanted the users to know that users are able to add and remove the members from the list by clarifying
        what each button refers to by clearly labeling them: "Filter by:," "Sort by:," "Add to Bias List." Additionally,
        by displaying "Average Age:," I wanted to help users learn that by adding members to the bias list, users can see the 
        average age of all of their biases in NCT. 
      </p>
      <h4>
        Reversibility
      </h4>
      <p>
        Reversibility is a design principle that says people should be able to recover from their inevitable mistakes. 
        Although it was required to have a way to clear the filters, I thought there could be
        different ways to do so. One way is to have a button "Clear All Filter" between
        where I display the list and the filter and sort buttons. By clicking this button, 
        it will sort by age and have no filter on any category. Another way is to give the users
        the ability to filter "All" on both categories and sort by anything at any given time. 
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    <div class="row" id="Conclusion">
      <h2 class="text-center"> Conclusion</h2>
      <p> 
        Based on these design principles, I was able to build the website using React-Bootstrap. Click "Development Website" below to explore my
        development website!
        <br />
        </p>
      <div class="text-center col-md-6 mx-auto">
        <a href="https://wailingwhale111.github.io/development-nct/"><img src="../development-cover.png" alt="website cover picture" class="mx-auto img-fluid max-width: 50%"></a>
        <a class="btn m-1" role="button" href="https://wailingwhale111.github.io/development-nct/" style="background-color:#254949; color:white"> 
          Development Website
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>
        <br/>
      If I were to build more on top of this project, I would want to explore the functionality of
      "position: sticky" within the bootstrap functionality. With this, I would want to have the filtering and sorting
      box on the left be accessible at any point of scrolling down the website; this way, the users don't have to
      scroll back up to filter and sort the members.
